# 3-D CFD Optimization of a Hemodialysis Catheter - Siemens PLM Software

Abstract: The U S reports more than 400,000 patients receiving dialysis treatment for end stage renal failure. Catheters serve as the primary means of providing dialysis treatments to new patients as well as on a sustained basis for those who have arteriovenous damage severe enough to prevent the use of a permanent access fistula. Catheter use is, however, not without risk. They are known to be susceptible to both thrombosis the formation of a blood clot, and hemolysis the rupturing of red blood cells releasing their contents into the bloodstream. Both of these contribute to the occurrence of vascular access morbidity. As many as 25 of catheters can result in at least a partial thrombosis. In addition, catheters must be shown to operate with a minimum of blood recirculation newly dialyzed blood being returned to the dialysis machine prior to circulating through the body. The current study uses 3-D CFD simulations to evaluate catheter performance in all three of these areas. An optimization algorithm is used to find new design concepts which will reduce the occurrence of thrombosis, hemolysis, and recirculation for the many patients dependent on catheters for their lives.
